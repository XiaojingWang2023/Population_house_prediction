# Population and Housing Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict population growth over the next 20 years and analyze whether different types of housing—such as single-detached houses, townhouses, and apartments etc can accommodate the increasing demand. 
The study provides insights into future housing needs under different population growth scenario.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Forecast population growth for the next 20 years.
- Analyze the supply and demand for different types of housing.
- Identify potential housing shortages or surpluses.
- Provide recommendations for immigration policy.

## 📊 Data Sources
The project relies on data from multiple sources, including:
- Government census reports
- Real estate market trends
- Historical population and housing datasets

## 🔍 Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Gather historical population and housing data.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identify trends in population growth and housing availability.
4. **Forecasting Population Growth:** Use predictive modeling techniques such as Linear Regression and Random Forest regression models.
5. **Housing Demand Analysis:** Estimate future housing needs based on population projections.
6. **Visualization & Reporting:** Create Power BI dashboards to present findings.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and interactive dashboards
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)**: Data analysis and machine learning
- **SQL**: Data storage and retrieval
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control

## 📈 Key Insights
- Expected population growth with different population such as nature increase, immigrants, non-permanent residentce.
- Housing shortages or surpluses based on predicted trends.
- Recommendations for immigrant policy.
